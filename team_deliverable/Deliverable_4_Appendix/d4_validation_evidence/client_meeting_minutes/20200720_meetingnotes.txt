Features shown in Demo:
-Viewing customer level at a restaurant as a customer user
-Viewing coupons available to redeem at a restaurant as a customer user
-Viewing coupons redeemed by customers as a restaurant owner

Feedback:
-We should add a page for view coupons that have already been used because that’s what the restaurant owner wants to track in our app
-Change the phrasing “buy coupon” to “redeem coupon”
-We should clarify what “available coupon” means (i.e. rename “available coupon”) on the customer-side restaurant page; are they available to redeem or available to use, etc.
-Re-demo once our achievement implementation is done
