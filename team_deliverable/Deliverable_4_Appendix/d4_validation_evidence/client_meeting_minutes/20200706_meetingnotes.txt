Features shown in Demo:
-Customer and restaurant owner registration
-Customer and restaurant owner login
-Restaurant search
-Coupon creation and restaurant coupon list, coupon deletion
-Employee creation, restaurant employee list, employee deletion

Feedback:
-Registration should be more focused on registration for the restaurant side, as customer side login is meant to be connected to the PickEasy app/integrated with PickEasy's user accounts
-Email Cho Yin and clarify how this integration should be handled/implemented, e.g. using PickEasy API
-Separate fields for coupon name and discount in coupon seems redundant, a single field should be sufficient
-Coupon creation should allow for creating coupons that are active indefinitely/don't have an expiry date
-It's important that the owner should be able to see the coupons redeemed by customers so that they have metrics on how useful the app has been in improving customer engagement/retention
