## Welcome!
1. Members of **Team Enterprise**  are expected to:
    * Familiarize themselves with this documentation
    * TBM
1. You are a respected member of this team, if you'd like to participate.  Let's make this the best team we possibly can.
1. Peer adjustment is a good way to encourage everyone to contribute. Every time from now on in this file, **peer adjustment** means you give up some weight to others.

## Methods of communication
1. Each member is expected and has the responsibility to participate in the discussion. 
1. **Slack** is the main tool we use for basic communication, with responding time less than 2 hours.(9a.m-12p.m) If the response time is always long, we may use peer adjustment.
1. **Zoom** (or maybe Teams) is the main tool we use for video communication.
    * Each member has 2 chances to be absent for some reasons. From the third time, peer adjustment may be used.
1. For emergency contact, we use mobile phone in case of network problems.
