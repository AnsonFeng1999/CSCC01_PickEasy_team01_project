This is where you should report bugs which you have not fixed.
You can delete when you fixed the bug of course. No need to change number.
Enjoy!

Test:

Bugs:
- Cannot edit restaurant information (host only)
- Using back / forward buttons on search page are buggy
- When scanning an achievement, if a user is not signed it an internal error is thrown
- (Fixed) If a owner deletes an achievement that a customer has completed/made progress on, then home page of that customer throws an internal error (host)
- (Fixed) Milestones are displayed out-of-order (host only)
- (Fixed) For updating the achievement progress, when you go back it takes you to the in-progress page, even if the achievement was completed or not scanned
- When incorrect information is entered for a coupon, the auto re-fill for name gets cut off sometimes

Visual Bugs:
- The restaurant name on owners home page looks very off compared to other styling
- (Fixed) Achievement creation is missing a closing div tag so the footer is in the parent block
- Pink line in nav bar disappearing when scrolling
- Icons for filtering restaurant achievements and the gear icons for owner settings faze through the nav bar when scrolling.
- Alignment of leaderboard is off

Questionable Design Choices:
- (Fixed) Coupon offers is the only page that does not have a filter option for the restaurant search (all, purchasable, non-purchasable)
- (Fixed) Restaurant settings page should be changed to milestone page
- (Fixed) The currently applied filter should be highlighted
- (Fixed) Search is case sensitive
- Customers cannot see their current points on the restaurant home page
- (Fixed) Customers view of restaurant achievement page should have a ‘all’ filter so they can see all available/in progress/completed achievement
